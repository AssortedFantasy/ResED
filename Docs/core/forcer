The forcer file defines several types of forces as functions of time

The super class, Forcer, expects a lambda function as a force argument

The subclasses of Force include:
    Constant force: expects a constant value as a force. Returns the same value regardless of time

    Polynomial force: expects an array of coefficients as a force argument, the position of each coefficient in the
                      array is used to determine the power it is associated with

    Sinosudal force: expects arguments describing amplitude, phase shift and angular frequency in that order
                     uses the math library for the sin function, angular frequency is in radians

    Audio force: expects a 1D array listing samples, and a sample rate to be read at, when passed a given time
                 it will return the sample located at the time multiplied by the sample rate

    Discrete force: expects an array of lambda functions as well as an array of time domains where they are applicable
                    since this would not be an analytic function, it will return DEFAULT_VALUE if the time is not within
                    the time domain
