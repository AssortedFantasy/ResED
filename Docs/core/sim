Sim is the file containing the main simulator class
This runs the actual simulation and is the file you Poll in order to get simulation data.

Making a simulation requires these parameters:
    Initial conditions: A numpy array or something that can be converted into a numpy array.
        Must be 5 * y * x

        The first two represent the initial positions and initial velocity of the grid.

        2, 3 and 4 represent in order:

        E : The Youngs Modulus
        1/P : One over the density
        B : The damping factor

    Optionally:
        Timestep, the simulation timestep, the smaller the finer the simulation runs.
        Edge conditions, How the laplace operator behaves along the edges. Must be one of
        reflect', 'constant', 'nearest', 'mirror', 'wrap'

        If its constant you may use the Last parameter, "edge_value" to define the constant.

Methods:
    simulate:
        Runs the simulation, n many steps.

    simulate_time:
        Runs the simulation, for t time.
