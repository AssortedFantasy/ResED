Sim is the file containing the main simulator class
This runs the actual simulation and is the file you Poll in order to get simulation data.

Making a simulation requires these parameters:

initial conditions: A numpy array or something that can be converted into a numpy array.
Must be 5 * y * x

The first two represent the initial positions and initial velocity of the grid.

2, 3 and 4 represent in order:

E : The Youngs Modulus
1/P : One over the density
B : The damping factor
